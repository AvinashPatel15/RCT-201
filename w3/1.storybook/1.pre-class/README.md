### Storybook

Storybook is a tool for UI development. It makes development faster and easier by isolating components. This allows you to work on one component at a time. You can develop entire UIs without needing to start up a complex dev stack, force certain data into your database, or navigate around your application.

### Getting Started

1. `npx create-react-app record`
2. `cd record`
3. `npx storybook init`
4. type `y` and then enter to proceed.
