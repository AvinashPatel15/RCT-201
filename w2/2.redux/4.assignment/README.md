# Notes Application With Redux

## Goals

1. Understanding useSelector
2. Understanding useDispatch
3. actions / actionTypes and reducers
4. Taking a step towards <B>CRUD</B>

## Part 1:

- Create a Notes application with Redux
- Define multiple components for different purposes
- The user should be able to add, delete and see all the notes created in form of cards.
- Create seperate routes
  - Create notes: localhost:8080/create
  - View single note: localhost:8080/{id}

## Part 2:

- Use Redux to manage everything
- Create seperate files for actions, actions types and reducers

## Bonus:
    - Create a route (localhost:8080/modify) to update the notes
    - To modify the notes, you should be logged in first.
